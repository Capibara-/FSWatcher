A cross platform file system watcher for .Net and Mono

FSWatcher uses various strategies to solve the nightmare that is
file system events. It uses a variation of native events and
raw polling determined by what is available.
The native .Net file system watcher is completely unreliable with
it's overflow exceptions. FSWatcher solves that and makes sure you
are notified about all file system changes.
